\section{Introduction}
This document outlines the protocol for a systematic literature review (SLR) on computational mathematics for AI, focusing on numerical methods and distributed computing techniques for deep learning on big data. The review will follow the PRISMA guidelines \citep{moher2009preferred} and Kitchenham's methodology for SLRs in software engineering \citep{kitchenham2007guidelines}.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Rationale}
As deep learning models grow in complexity and data volumes continue to increase, there is a critical need to understand and optimize the computational methods underpinning these systems. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on numerical methods and distributed computing techniques specifically applied to deep learning in big data contexts.

\subsection{Objectives}
The primary objectives of this SLR are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To identify and categorize state-of-the-art numerical methods used in deep learning for big data.
    \item To evaluate the effectiveness of various distributed computing techniques for scaling deep learning to big data problems.
    \item To compare these methods and techniques in terms of computational efficiency, scalability, and accuracy.
    \item To identify emerging trends and future directions in this field.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Methodology}

This study employs a comprehensive approach combining two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) with subsequent meta-analysis and network analysis. The methodology is structured into seven distinct phases:

\subsection{Phase 1: Planning and Protocol Development}

\subsubsection{Research Questions}
For SLR 1 (Numerical Methods):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[RQ1.1] What are the state-of-the-art numerical methods used in deep learning for big data?
    \item[RQ1.2] How do these methods perform in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy?
\end{enumerate}

For SLR 2 (Distributed Computing Techniques):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[RQ2.1] What distributed computing techniques are used for scaling deep learning to big data problems?
    \item[RQ2.2] How effective are these techniques in terms of scalability and performance?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Literature Review Classification Framework}
We will use Cooper's taxonomy \citep{cooper1988} to classify the literature in both SLRs:

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Adaptation of Cooper's Literature Review Taxonomy}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
Characteristic & Categories \\
\hline
(a) Focus     & Research outcomes, Research methods, Theories, Practices or applications \\
(b) Goal      & Integration, Criticism, Identification of central issues \\
(c) Perspective & Neutral representation, Espousal of position \\
(d) Coverage  & Exhaustive, Exhaustive with selective citation, Representative, Central or pivotal \\
(e) Organization & Historical, Conceptual, Methodological \\
(f) Audience  & Specialized scholars, General scholars, Practitioners or policymakers, General public \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This classification will be applied to each included study during the data extraction phase. It will help us to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Systematically categorize the nature and scope of each study
    \item Identify patterns and trends in the literature
    \item Ensure a balanced representation of different types of research in our review
    \item Tailor our findings to different audience needs
    \item Guide our analysis and synthesis of the literature
\end{itemize}

The classification results will be used in Phase 6 (Study Classification and Bias Assessment) to provide additional context for interpreting our findings and identifying gaps in the current research landscape.

\subsubsection{Search Strategy Development}
PICO-based search strings for each SLR:

SLR 1:
\begin{verbatim}
(("deep learning" OR "neural network*") AND 
("numerical method*" OR "optimization algorithm*") AND 
("big data" OR "large-scale") AND 
(efficiency OR accuracy))
\end{verbatim}

SLR 2:
\begin{verbatim}
(("deep learning" OR "neural network*") AND 
("distributed computing" OR "parallel processing" OR 
"GPU acceleration" OR "federated learning") AND 
("big data" OR "large-scale") AND 
(scalability OR performance))
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Information Sources}
IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, Scopus, Web of Science, JSTOR, AIS 

\subsubsection{Eligibility Criteria}
Inclusion:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Studies from 2019-2024

    \item Rigour, credibility, and relevance
\end{enumerate}

Quality threshold: 75\% positive responses, 75\% inter-rater reliability (Krippendorff's q > 0.8)

\begin{itemize}
    \item Focus, Goal, Perspective, Coverage, Organization, Audience
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assessment of Meta-Bias}
\begin{itemize}

This phased approach ensures a systematic and comprehensive review of computational mathematics for AI in big data contexts, combining insights from numerical methods and distributed computing techniques.

\section{Discussion}
This systematic review will provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of numerical methods and distributed computing techniques for deep learning on big data. The findings will be interpreted considering the strength of evidence, applicability, and generalizability. Limitations of the review and the included studies will be discussed, and implications for future research will be outlined.
