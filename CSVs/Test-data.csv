Big Data for Operational Efficiency of Transport and Logistics: A Review,Conference,2017,T. Borgi; N. Zoghlami; M. Abed; M. S. Naceur,"In the new information and communication era, digital transformation and adoption of recent technological advances have become a must for all transport and logistics providers who aim to significantly improve their activities. Consequently, this digitalization is inevitably giving birth to voluminous and rapidly growing sets of large-scale data generated from heterogeneous data sources, also known as Big Data. With particular management infrastructures and advanced data analysis methodologies, these huge amounts of data can be efficiently harvested to optimize the logistics and transport operations and provide a higher quality of service. This paper provides a review of the application of Big Data technologies in improving the operational efficiency of transport and logistics, exposes the main use cases and identifies some future research challenges.",10.1109/ICAdLT.2017.8547029,2017 6th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Logistics and Transport (ICALT),IEEE,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8547029,978-1-5386-1623-9,

Big data in finance and the growth of large firms,Journal,2018,"Begenau J,Farboodi M,Veldkamp L","Two modern economic trends are the increase in firm size and advances in information technology. We explore the hypothesis that big data disproportionately benefits big firms. Because they have more economic activity and a longer firm history, large firms have produced more data. As processor speed rises, abundant data attracts more financial analysis. Data analysis improves investors’ forecasts and reduces equity uncertainty, reducing the firm’s cost of capital. When investors can process more data, large firm investment costs fall by more, enabling large firms to grow larger.",10.1016/j.jmoneco.2018.05.013,Journal of Monetary Economics,ScienceDirect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393218302174;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2018.05.013,,

Antecedents to firm performance and competitiveness using the lens of big data analytics: a cross-cultural study,Journal,2022,Behl A.,"Purpose: The study aims to understand how big data analytics capabilities of tech startups help them gain competitive advantage and improve their firm performance. The study is performed for two countries: India and China. A comparative analysis is also discussed in the study. Design/methodology/approach: The study collected responses from tech startups from both India and China. A total of 502 responses were collected with 269 from India and 233 from China. The results were analyzed using Warp PLS 6.0 after testing for common method bias, endogeneity and reliability of data. The study tested five primary hypotheses and also tested the effect of two control variables: country of origin of startup and age of the startup. Findings: We found that big data analytics capabilities have a positive and significant impact on the firm performance and competitive advantage of tech startups. While organizational culture proved to have a positive impact as a moderator, innovation was found to have non-significant effect. The results also found to have non-significant effect of age of the firm while its country of origin does play an important role in defining its success. Originality/value: The study offer key insights for the tech startups operating in two countries which are geographically neighbors but differ in the tech expertise from each other. Moreover, the study offers key insights on how does the origin of the country contributes significantly to explaining the success and competitiveness of the firm. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/MD-01-2020-0121,Management Decision,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086174673&doi=10.1108%2fMD-01-2020-0121&partnerID=40&md5=67412648fe00b53c81e8555cdc988f03,,
An empirical investigation on how big data analytics influence China SMEs performance: do product and process innovation matter?,Journal,2020,Saleem H.; Li Y.; Ali Z.; Mehreen A.; Mansoor M.S.,"Globalization and a keen interest in big data have directed the firms to develop and utilize big data analytics (BDA) to bring technological innovation (TI) and enhance firm productivity. Using resource-based view theory (RBVT), we intend to predict TI and SMEs’ performance through BDA. Therefore, we recruited 312 Chinese SMEs’ officials using survey methods. The proposed model and structural associations were examined in AMOS. The findings suggest that BDA (predictive-and-prescriptive) is positively related to TI (product-and-process) and SMEs’ performance. Moreover, TI (product-and-process) mediates the relationship between BDA and SMEs performance.

The Effect of Big Data and Analytics on Firm Performance: An Econometric Analysis Considering Industry Characteristics,Journal,2018,Müller O.; Fay M.; vom Brocke J.,"The emergence of big data has stimulated enormous investments into business analytics solutions, but large-scale and reliable empirical evidence about the business value of big data and analytics (BDA) remains scarce. This article presents the results of an econometric study that analyzes the direction, sign, and magnitude of the relationship between BDA and firm performance based on objective measurements of BDA assets. Using a unique panel data set that contains detailed information about BDA solutions owned by 814 companies during the time frame from 2008 to 2014, on the one hand, and their financial performance, on the other hand, we estimate the relationship between BDA assets and firm productivity and find that live BDA assets are associated with an average of 3–7 percent improvement in firm productivity. Yet we also find substantial differences in returns from BDA when we consider the industry in which a firm operates. While firms in information technology-intensive or highly competitive industries are clearly able to extract value from BDA assets, we did not detect measurable productivity improvement for firms outside these industry groups. Taken together, our findings provide robust empirical evidence for the business value of BDA, but also highlight important boundary conditions.

Dose the Use of Big Data Analytics Guarantee a High Firm Performance? An Empirical Study Bases on the Dynamic Capabilities Theory,Conference,2018,Sun H.; Ren J.,"For the sake of enriching relevant research field, this study focuses on two main questions: (1) What is the effect of DBA usage on firm performance (including market performance and operational performance) and (2) What factors that drive organizations to use big data analytics (BDA) are key drivers, based on dynamic capabilities theory And we also identified the moderating effect of environmental dynamism between BDA use and firm performance. Furthermore, we introduce the need pull/technology push framework to identify and theorize paths via which factors influence the use of BDA. Purely from the need pull/technology push theory perspective, we propose that perceived usefulness of BDA should belong to need pull factor. Thus, we select perceived usefulness and satisfaction level with existing IT technology as need pull factors, BDA use of competitors and technology compatibility as technology push factors for big data analytics (BDA) use, and examines if these factors have a positive effect on big data analytics (BDA). © 2018 IEEE.",10.1109/ICSSSM.2018.8465056,"2018 15th International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management, ICSSSM 2018",Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054392498&doi=10.1109%2fICSSSM.2018.8465056&partnerID=40&md5=43fd4c9f06e1b852a8d696236c3bbf2a,,
Big data analytics influence on financial performance and market value: Intellectual capital as a proxy,Conference,2021,Nejjari Z.; Aamoum H.,"Big data (BD) analytics is emerging as a valuable innovative research area for academics and professionals, showing the substantial requirement in an information-motivated economy focused on knowledge for answers to the market issues. It isn't simple to effectively utilize the emerging technology, and it's actually more difficult to evaluate the BD involvement in enhancing company performance. Furthermore, empirical research exploring the effects on financial performance and market value of the BD remain limited. In evaluating its impact on firm value, this research suggested employing the companies intellectual (IC) capital as a substitute for the BD efficiency deployment. This research utilized the VAIC technique to determine IC, through its principal constituents: capital employed efficiency, structural capital efficiency, human capital efficiency and subsequently applied the SEM method to examine the model fit. The data in this research comprise 29 Moroccan firms registered on the Casablanca Stock Exchange (CSE). These firms are part of 8 sectors: Food producers and processors, banks, Insurance, building and construction materials, participation and promotion real estate, distributors, mining, hardware, software and IT services.

Impact of big data analytics on sales performance in pharmaceutical organizations: The role of customer relationship management capabilities,Journal,2021,Shahbaz M.; Gao C.; Zhai L.; Shahzad F.; Luqman A.; Zahid R.,"In this era of technology development, every business wants to equip its salesforce with a sustainable salesforce automation system to improve sales performance and customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities. This study investigates the impact of big data analytics (BDA) on CRM capabilities and the sales performance of pharmaceutical organizations. A research model was tested based on 416 valid responses collected from pharmaceutical companies through a structured questionnaire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed using Smart-PLS3 to confirm the contribution of BDA to improving CRM capabilities and sales performance. The study finds that individual characteristics such as self-efficacy, playfulness, and social norms, along with organizational characteristics such as voluntariness, user involvement, user participation, and management support, are positive predictors of salesforce perception of BDA. This positive perception of BDA increased the person-technology fit in the salesforce, which ultimately increased the CRM capabilities and sales performance. © 2021 Shahbaz et al.

Toward an Understanding of Big Data Analytics and Competitive Performance,Journal,2021,Danielsen F.; Olsen D.; Framnes V.A.,"The most significant enterprise system topic over the last decade is business intelligence and analytics. Big data analytics is now viewed as a disruptive technology that will significantly transform business intelligence and analytics. Therefore, big data technology, as a way to analyze and comprehend turbulent environments, has attracted huge interest from researchers and practitioners. Such environments are highly challenging for enterpris-es; how can they deal with such turbulence and stay competitive? The valuable information that this technology can offer seems almost limitless. Can big data help organizations deal with turbulent environments, and if so, how? We address this question by closely examining the relations between (1) big data analytics capabilities and dynamic capabilities, (2) dynamic capabilities and competitive performance, (3) big data analytics capabilities and operational capabilities, and (4) operational capabilities and competitive performance. Big data analytics capabilities are necessary to use big data effectively. We developed a model with four hypotheses to investigate these relations. We conducted a survey among 107 respondents from the largest companies in the Nordic countries. All but one of our hypotheses were supported. This research contributes to a better understanding of how big data analytic investments support agile capabilities, in turn promoting competitive performance. © Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems,.",,Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126451031&partnerID=40&md5=979377e5180e85604c23b96dfe46c4fa,,
How and When Does Big Data Analytics Capability Boost Innovation Performance?,Journal,2023,Zhang H.; Yuan S.,"The diffusion of big data in recent years has stimulated many companies to develop big data analytics capability (BDAC) to boost innovation performance. However, research regarding how and when BDAC can increase innovation performance is still scant. This study aims to test how (i.e., the mediating role of strategic flexibility and strategic innovation) and when (i.e., the moderating role of environmental uncertainty) BDAC can boost a firm’s innovation performance drawing on resource-based theory. Through a survey of 421 Chinese managers and employees who are engaged in the field of big data analytics, this study reveals that (1) BDAC has a positive effect on innovation performance, (2) strategic flexibility and strategic innovation play a significant serial mediating role in this relationship, and (3) the positive effect of BDAC on innovation performance is more significant under high (vs. low) environmental uncertainty conditions. This study contributes to the extant literature by verifying how BDAC can increase a firm’s innovation performance through the serial mediating role of strategic flexibility and strategic innovation. It also confirms a contingent factor (i.e., environmental uncertainty) regarding the positive effect of BDAC on innovation performance. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/su15054036,Sustainability (Switzerland),Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149700724&doi=10.3390%2fsu15054036&partnerID=40&md5=2ab193cfd5acc5e4cbf699424595d703,,

Influence of big data analytical capability on new product performance – the effects of collaboration capability and team collaboration in high-tech firm,Journal,2024,Chen C.-H.,"Purpose: As the application of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent, many high-tech firms have employed AI applications to deal with emerging societal, technological and environmental challenges. Big data analytical capability (BDAC) has become increasingly important in the AI application processes. Drawing upon the resource-based view and the theory of planned behavior, this study aims to investigate how BDAC and collaboration affect new product performance (NPP). Practically, a harmonic working team is particularly important for creating management synergies, this empirical analysis demonstrates the importance of BDAC and collaboration for NPP. Design/methodology/approach: This paper focuses on the performance of firms that applied AI in their operations. This study collected data from firms in Greater China, including China and Taiwan, as Greater China is currently the leading manufacturer of semiconductor, electronic and electric products for AI applications in the manufacturing process. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling is employed for statistical analysis. Findings: The analytical results indicate that BDAC positively relates to collaboration capability (CC) in AI applications but not to team collaboration (TC). CC positively correlates with TC, and both CC and TC positively correlate with NPP. Further, the mediating effect was examined using the Sobel t-test, which reveals that CC is a significant mediator in the influence of BDAC on NPP. Practical implications: The strategic implementation of BDAC and collaboration can allow an enterprise to improve its NPP when driven by the external environment to use AI, which further enhances NPP. These processes indicate that AI and BDAC are both crucial for the success of a company’s collaboration and for effective management to improve NPP in the face of global competition. Originality/value: This study introduces the concept of BDAC to explain the relationship between CC and TC, as they pertain to NPP. This study presented a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the research findings and could provide a framework for managing BDAC. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/CMS-02-2022-0053,Chinese Management Studies,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143050370&doi=10.1108%2fCMS-02-2022-0053&partnerID=40&md5=4f5c854b27f454d55cafa3bf603675ac,,

Boosting innovation performance through big data analytics:An empirical investigationon the role of firm agility,Journal,2023,ZareRavasan A.,"While past studies proposed the role of big data analytics (BDA) as one of the primary pathways to business value creation, current knowledge on the link between BDA and innovation performance remains limited. In this regard, this study intends to fill this research gap by developing a theoretical framework for understanding how and under which mechanisms BDA influences innovation performance. Firm agility (conceptualised as sensing agility, decision-making agility and acting agility) is used in this research as the mediator between BDA and innovation performance. Besides, this research conceptualises two moderating variables: data-driven culture and BDA team sophistication. This study employs partial least squares (PLS) to test and validate the proposed hypotheses using survey data of 185 firms. The results show that firm agility significantly mediates the link between BDA use and innovation performance. Besides, the results suggest that data-driven culture moderates the relation between sensing agility and decision-making agility. This research also supports the moderating role of BDA team sophistication on the link between BDA use and sensing agility. © The Author(s) 2021.",10.1177/01655515211047425,Journal of Information Science,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116973032&doi=10.1177%2f01655515211047425&partnerID=40&md5=32da97c0610a7fd20de0f2a50fef5ec1,,no paper

We grounded our theoretical framework in two perspectives: the resource-based view and the dynamic capabilities view. In order to gather data from Saudi Arabian managers, we used the positivist methodology of a survey. Data were collected from 410 managers. The data were analysed using the SEM method. The findings indicated that big data analytics capabilities have a significant effect on economic, environmental, and social performance. They also revealed that strategic agility partially mediates the relationship between the capabilities of big data analytics and sustainable performance. Furthermore, the impact of big data analytics capabilities on strategic agility is stronger in a creative environment, while the strategic agility–sustainable performance relationship is more pronounced in more creative environments. The findings offer firms an insight into the actual benefits that big data analytics may generate and how firms may align the use of big data analytics with industrial conditions to foster sustainable performance. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/su15097623,Sustainability (Switzerland),Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159260876&doi=10.3390%2fsu15097623&partnerID=40&md5=3e6fe2d1a2f7d7837ae829add61fc038,,

Through emerging technologies, business organizations are able to collect and analyze essential information vital for the acceleration of innovation. Therefore, this study investigated how big data contribute to the innovation activities of manufacturing entrepreneurs in terms of big data analytic capability (BDAC). The aim of this study was to relate BDAC to organizational readiness and innovation performance (IP). Moreover, we examined the mediating role of organizational readiness between BDAC and IP. We also examined the strengthening role of digital orientation. To collect the study data, we approached 494 frontline managers of the manufacturing sector of Saudi Arabia. The collected data were analyzed using statistical techniques such as descriptive, correlation, and hierarchical regression techniques. We found that BDAC plays a vital role in developing organizational readiness and IP. The findings also proved that organizational readiness has a significant effect on IP. The results revealed that organizational readiness mediates between BDAC and IP. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/systems11060284,Systems,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163649840&doi=10.3390%2fsystems11060284&partnerID=40&md5=e48ba84dd91d76ff40d60b558a542596,,
"Circular supply chain practices, big data implementation and firm performance: Mediating role of digital technology",Journal,2024,Kiran F.; Sahin B.,"The business practices such as supply chains have been transformed significantly due to technological advancement and digitalization. It helps enhance organizational efficiency in consumption, production, and overall operation. Additionally, big data within the supply chain management process has considerably assisted businesses in gathering accurate product information, easily tracing a product, maintaining track of distribution cycles and delivering goods as quickly as possible. The research investigates the impact of the circular supply chain (CSC) and big data implementation on firm performance, specifically in the Pakistan Manufacturing Sector. Further, it has investigated digital technologies' mediating role in the firm's performance in the Pakistan manufacturing sector. The research was conducted using quantitative data from the questionnaire survey from 400 participants (i.e., firm managers) working in the Pakistan manufacturing sector. The data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling comprising confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis using SmartPLS. Findings show a negative and significant influence of CSC practices on firm performance in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan. On the contrary, big data implementation positively and significantly impacts the firms' performance. Further, the mediating role of digital technology over firm performance through CSC practices and big data implementation was also found to be positive and significant. The research has contributed to the present state of literature in different ways. First, the research presented the mediating role of digital technologies in the relationship between CSC and big data implementation and firm performance. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1002/isd2.12290,Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166620668&doi=10.1002%2fisd2.12290&partnerID=40&md5=1c03de93f042845d2064afdb4a1f68f5,,
Impacts of big data analytics adoption on firm sustainability performance,Journal,2023,Chatterjee S.; Chaudhuri R.; Vrontis D.; Thrassou A.,"Purpose: This study aims to examine the impacts of adopting big data analytics (BDA) on firm sustainability performance (FSP) mediated through firm financial performance (FIP) and operational performance (OPP). Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model is based on ideas from existing literature on BDA, sustainability, FIP, dynamic capability view theory and resource capability view theory. The model is then validated using the partial least squares–structural equation modeling technique with consideration of 312 responses from 24 Indian firms. Findings: The study provides three important findings. First, there is a significant and positive impact of BDA on firms’ financial and OPP. Second, BDA significantly and positively impacts firm business process performance (BPP) and dynamic capabilities (DYC), which, in turn, significantly impacts the firm’s financial and OPP. Finally, both the financial and OPP of the firm significantly and positively impact sustainability performance. Research limitations/implications: This theoretical model is unique in showing the impacts of BDA on BPP, firm DYC, financial and OPP. The study also shows how BDA can enhance FSP by mediating through financial as well as the OPP of the firms. The study uses data only from India and thus the proposed model cannot be generalizable. Originality/value: This study provides valuable input to researchers, academicians and industry practitioners on the importance of BDA for FSP. The study also adds value to the body of knowledge on sustainability, FIP and technology adoption. The proposed unique theoretical model has an explanative power of 70%, which is quite high and can be used across different industries. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/QRFM-01-2022-0005,Qualitative Research in Financial Markets,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131597957&doi=10.1108%2fQRFM-01-2022-0005&partnerID=40&md5=654e691660524fa5fbfa7591d82b3bff,,
"Examining the relationships between big data analytics capability, entrepreneurial orientation and sustainable supply chain performance: moderating role of trust",Journal,2023,Tipu S.A.A.; Fantazy K.,"Purpose: Using a dynamic capability view, this study examined the relationships between big data analytics capability (BDAC), entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP) by exploring the moderating role of trust among supply chain partners. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaires were collected from 300 manufacturing organizations using snow sampling. The moderating connections and direct relationships were examined using Hays' process macro and structural equation modeling. Findings: BDAC was positively related to EO and SSCP. When supply chain partners experienced low levels of trust, an increase in BDAC did not enhance SSCP. As trust increased, the relationship between BDAC and SSCP became more positive, underpinning the moderating effects of trust. Moreover, trust did not moderate the relationship between BDAC and EO. The moderating effect of trust on the relationship between EO and SSCP showed a positive relationship between EO and SSCP when trust was low; however, the relationship became negative when trust was high. Practical implications: Developing technology alone may not be sufficient, as supply chain managers need to establish a strong business relationship based on mutual trust. However, they also need to be aware of the dangers of high levels of trust because these may negatively affect performance. Therefore, supply chain managers need to achieve an optimal level of trust that is neither excessive nor insufficient. Originality/value: Advances in technology and entrepreneurial drive for supply chain sustainability make it pertinent to examine trust levels among supply chain partners and the varying impact on BDAC, EO and SSCP. The current study shows the negative aspects of too much trust among supply chain partners. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/BIJ-04-2023-0206,Benchmarking,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174298899&doi=10.1108%2fBIJ-04-2023-0206&partnerID=40&md5=469a623b372f355f584ba213827ac834,,
Impact of big data technological and personal capabilities on sustainable performance on Jordanian manufacturing companies: the mediating role of innovation,Journal,2023,Jum'a L.; Zimon D.; Madzik P.,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical model that explains the impact of big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) on company's supply chain innovation capabilities and sustainable supply chain performance. BDAC is represented through two dimensions of big data technological capabilities (BDTC) and big data personal capabilities (BDPC). Moreover, the relationships between BDTC and BDPC with sustainable supply chain performance through the mediation effect of supply chain innovation capabilities are examined. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a quantitative research approach. A survey of 400 Jordanian manufacturing companies was carried out to conduct this research. However, the responses of 207 managers were valid to be used in the analysis. In this study, the SmartPLS software was used to perform structural equation modeling using a partial least squares approach (PLS-SEM) and to examine the measurement and structural model's validity and reliability. Findings: According to the results of this study, BDPC has a significant positive impact on supply chain innovation capabilities. Furthermore, the findings indicate that supply chain innovation capabilities are the most influential predictor of sustainable supply chain performance and act as a positive significant mediator in the relationship between BDPC and firm sustainable performance. Surprisingly, the study found that BDTC had no significant effect on supply chain innovation capabilities. Besides that, no significant relationship exists between BDTC and firm sustainable performance via the mediation effect of supply chain innovation capabilities. Originality/value: This study provides an integrated research model that incorporates BDAC, supply chain innovation capabilities, and sustainable supply chain performance in order to analyze supply chain innovation and sustainable supply chain performance. This suggests that the scope of the study is broader in terms of predicting sustainable supply chain performance. As a result, the study intends to fill a gap in the literature by explaining how BDAC affects supply chain innovation capabilities and firms sustainable performance. In addition, the role of supply chain innovation capabilities as a mediator between BDAC and sustainable supply chain performance is investigated. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/JEIM-09-2022-0323,Journal of Enterprise Information Management,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164521018&doi=10.1108%2fJEIM-09-2022-0323&partnerID=40&md5=b65beaecf033f978c2d0b10b62853970,,
Effects of big data analytics capability on performance of internet enterprises: chain mediating effects of strategic flexibility and strategic innovation,Journal,2023,Zhang H.; Wang L.; Yang H.; Yu C.; Xia F.; Xue X.,"The recent interest in big data has led many companies to develop big data analytics capability (BDAC) in order to enhance Firm Performance (FP). However, BDAC pays off for some companies but not for others. It appears that very few have achieved a big impact through big data. To address this challenge, this study proposes a BDAC model drawing on the resource-based theory and the dynamic capability theory. In order to carry out the research, this paper takes Chinese internet enterprises as the research object and obtains survey data from 629 employees through questionnaires. Through the test of the proposed chain mediation model using the bootstrap method, it is found that: (1) big data analytics capability has significant positive influences on firm performance of internet enterprises; (2) strategic flexibility and strategic innovation play chain mediating roles on the path joining big data analytics capability and firm performance.

However, research in this domain is limited. Accordingly, the present research seeks to understand how big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) add value to tourism supply chains (TSCs) and can dynamic capabilities (DC) improve the triple bottom line. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 218 valid responses were collected from different Indian tourism industry units. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to confirm the constructs, followed by partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to check the mediating effect of DC on TSCs performance. Findings: The findings show that BDAC significantly influence the performance of TSCs and that DC plays a critical role in strengthening the impact of BDAC on TSCs' economic performance. These results corroborate that DC plays a key moderating role. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes significantly to the tourism sector in India, where tourism is a key contributor to the country's gross domestic product. Theoretically, this study contributes to the resource-based view (RBV) and practically encourages professionals in the tourism sector to promote the use of BDAC to enhance the performance of TSCs. Originality/value: The originality of the study is that it has tried to comprehend the moderating role of dynamic capabilities which impact BDAC to improve TSC performance. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/IJLM-03-2022-0125,International Journal of Logistics Management,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169794400&doi=10.1108%2fIJLM-03-2022-0125&partnerID=40&md5=63b1dfbc65807f9d5e7081980b8b6634,,
Big Data Analytics Capability and Governmental Performance: An Empirical Examination,Journal,2023,Ongena G.; Davids A.,"Although governments are investing heavily in big data analytics, reports show mixed results in terms of performance. Whilst big data analytics capability provided a valuable lens in business and seems useful for the public sector, there is little knowledge of its relationship with governmental performance. This study aims to explain how big data analytics capability led to governmental performance. Using a survey research methodology, an integrated conceptual model is proposed highlighting a comprehensive set of big data analytics resources influencing governmental performance. The conceptual model was developed based on prior literature. Using a PLS-SEM approach, the results strongly support the posited hypotheses. Big data analytics capability has a strong impact on governmental efficiency, effectiveness, and fairness. The findings of this paper confirmed the imperative role of big data analytics capability in governmental performance in the public sector, which earlier studies found in the private sector. This study also validated measures of governmental performance. © 2023 IGI Global.

The Use of Inside-Out and Outside-In Big Data Analytics on E-Platforms: Performance Impacts and Heterogeneity Analysis,Journal,2023,Liu Y.; Zheng Y.; Wei J.; Yang Y.,"Big data has brought unprecedented opportunities and challenges, prompting global firms to grow big data analytics (BDA) investments, especially in a turbulent business environment. However, there is insufficient empirical evidence in scholarly research on whether and how using BDA functions of various types creates business value. The current study divides BDA into inside-out and outside-in types and explores whether and how firms can create value by using functions of these two types of BDA. Then, the knowledge-based view (KBV) is applied as a theoretical foundation to investigate the independent and combined impacts of inside-out and outside-in BDA usage on firms’ sales performance. Furthermore, we build a quantile regression model to analyze the heterogeneity of independent and combined impacts among firms with different performance levels. The empirical study is based on a unique dataset collected on one of the largest electronic platforms (e-platforms) in China from 785 firms in 35 weeks. The results of the benchmark model based on two-way fixed effects show that both inside-out and outside-in BDA usage, as well as their interactions, are positively related to the sales performance of firms on e-platforms. The heterogeneity analysis indicates that inside-out (outside-in) BDA functions have a greater degree of impact on firms with lower (higher) sales performance. Through the theoretical and empirical analysis of the complex performance impacts of BDA usage, this study enriches the understanding of value creation in using multiple BDA functions and extends the theoretical account of KBV in the field of BDA. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/10864415.2022.2158595,International Journal of Electronic Commerce,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148281078&doi=10.1080%2f10864415.2022.2158595&partnerID=40&md5=d7f974d7487865efde324591ba0beca9,,
The intermediating role of big data analytics capability between responsive and proactive market orientations and firm performance in the retail industry,Journal,2023,Morimura F.; Sakagawa Y.,"Big data analytics capability (BDAC) is the key resource for competitive advantage in the drastically changing market. Although some studies have investigated the impacts on firm performance, there is limited understanding of how firms enhance their BDAC. This study draws on organisational culture and investigates the effects of responsive and proactive market orientations on BDAC and firm performance. The results show that both responsive and proactive market orientations increase BDAC. Further, BDAC fully mediates the relationship between these two market orientations and firm performance. Our findings suggest that BDAC researchers should focus on market orientations that enhance BDAC. © 2022",10.1016/j.jretconser.2022.103193,Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142196638&doi=10.1016%2fj.jretconser.2022.103193&partnerID=40&md5=06affec564f9177823b1b3633d93c1e0,,

The impact of big data analytics and artificial intelligence on green supply chain process integration and hospital environmental performance,Journal,2021,Benzidia S.; Makaoui N.; Bentahar O.,"Big data analytics and artificial intelligence (BDA-AI) technologies have attracted increasing interest in recent years from academics and practitioners. However, few empirical studies have investigated the benefits of BDA-AI in the supply chain integration process and its impact on environmental performance. To fill this gap, we extended the organizational information processing theory by integrating BDA-AI and positioning digital learning as a moderator of the green supply chain process. We developed a conceptual model to test a sample of data from 168 French hospitals using a partial least squares regression-based structural equation modeling method. The findings showed that the use of BDA-AI technologies has a significant effect on environmental process integration and green supply chain collaboration. The study also underlined that both environmental process integration and green supply chain collaboration have a significant impact on environmental performance. The results highlight the moderating role of green digital learning in the relationships between BDA-AI and green supply chain collaboration, a major finding that has not been highlighted in the extant literature.

The impact of big data adoption on smes’ performance,Journal,2021,Nasrollahi M.; Ramezani J.; Sadraei M.,"The notion of Industry 4.0 encompasses the adoption of new information technologies that enable an enormous amount of information to be digitally collected, analyzed, and exploited in organizations to make better decisions. Therefore, finding how organizations can adopt big data (BD) components to improve their performance becomes a relevant research area. This issue is becoming more pertinent for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), especially in developing countries that encounter limited resources and infrastructures. Due to the lack of empirical studies related to big data adoption (BDA) and BD’s business value, especially in SMEs, this study investigates the impact of BDA on SMEs’ performance by obtaining the required data from experts. The quantitative investigation followed a mixed approach, including survey data from 224 managers from Iranian SMEs, and a structural equation modeling (SEM) methodology for the data analysis. Results showed that 12 factors affected the BDA in SMEs. BDA can affect both operational performance and economic performance. There has been no support for the influence of BDA and economic performance on social performance. Finally, the study implications and findings are discussed alongside future research suggestions, as well as some limitations and unanswered questions. © 2021 by the authors.

Big data analytics for improving financial performance and sustainability,Journal,2021,Zhu X.; Yang Y.,"In this study, the key drivers of sustainability commitment, green supply chain manage-ment, big data integration and green human resource practice are explored, and the impact of these sustainable capabilities on the environmental and financial performance of banks is also elaborated. In addition, the influence of green management practices on integrating big data technology into operations is presented. As for the concept of dynamic ability, it has been used to recommend and empirically test conceptual models. Data were collected through a self-administrated survey questionnaire on 317 people working in 37 banks in six Asian countries. Research suggests that big data analytics strategies have an impact on internal processes and on the stability and financial performance of banks. Besides, it is indicated that banks are committed to proper data monitoring of their customers to complete operational efficiency and sustainability goals. Furthermore, our result proved that banks practicing Green Innovation strategies experience better environmental and economic performance because their employees are already trained in Green HR. Finally, from our study, it was found that internal and external green supply chain management practices have a positive effect on the environmental and financial performance of banks, thus ensuring that the bank of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) mitigates the environmental impact through its operations and ultimately experiences an increase in financial performance. © 2021, Science in China Press.

Application of big data analytics and organizational performance: the mediating role of knowledge management practices,Journal,2020,Shabbir M.Q.; Gardezi S.B.W.,"Drawing from tenets of the resource-based theory, we propose and test a model that examines the relationship between the application of big data analytics (ABDA) and organizational performance (OP) in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Further, this study examines the mediating role of knowledge management practices (KMP) in relation to the ABDA and OP. Data were collected from respondents working in SMEs through an adapted instrument. This research study adopts the Baron–Kenny approach to test the mediation. The results indicated that the ABDA had a positive and significant impact on OP. Also, KMP had partially mediated the relationship between ABDA and OP in SMEs. The dataset was solely comprised of SMEs from Pakistan administered Kashmir and may not reflect the insights from other regions. Hence limits the generalizability of the results.

Organizational performance and capabilities to analyze big data: do the ambidexterity and business value of big data analytics matter?,Journal,2021,Aljumah A.I.; Nuseir M.T.; Alam M.M.,"Purpose: The aim of the study is to examine the impact of the big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) on the organizational performance. The study also examines the mediating role of ambidexterity and the moderating role of business value of big data (BVBD) analytics in the relationship between the big data analytics capabilities and the organizational performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected primary data based on a questionnaire survey among the large manufacturing firms operating in UAE. A total of 650 questionnaires were distributed among the manufacturing firms and 295 samples were used for final data analysis. The survey was conducted from September to November in 2019, and data were analyzed based on partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The big data analysis (BDA) scalability is supported by the findings on the performance of firm and its determinants such as system, value of business and quality of information. The roles of business value as a moderator and ambidexterity as mediator are found significant. The results reveal that there is a need for managers to consider the business value and quality dynamics as crucial strategic objectives to achieve high performance of the firm. Research limitations/implications: The study has significant policy implication for practitioners and researchers for understanding the issues related to big data analytics.

Big data analytics capability and decision-making: The role of data-driven insight on circular economy performance,Journal,2021,Awan U.; Shamim S.; Khan Z.; Zia N.U.; Shariq S.M.; Khan M.N.,"Big data analytics (BDA) is a revolutionary approach for sound decision-making in organizations that can lead to remarkable changes in transforming and supporting the circular economy (CE). However, extant literature on BDA capability has paid limited attention to understanding the enabling role of data-driven insights for supporting decision-making and, consequently, enhancing CE performance. We argue that firms drive decision-making quality through data-driven insights, business intelligence and analytics (BI&A), and BDA capability. In this study, we empirically investigated the association of BDA capability with CE performance and examined the mediating role of data-driven insights in the relationship between BDA capability and decision-making. Data were collected from 109 Czech manufacturing firms, and partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the data. The results reveal that BDA capability and BI&A are positively associated with decision-making quality. This effect is stronger when the manufacturer utilizes data-driven insights. The results demonstrate that BDA capability drives decision-making quality in organizations, and data-driven insights do not mediate this relationship. BI&A is associated with decision-making quality through data-driven insights. These findings offer important insights to managers, as they can act as a reference point for developing data-driven insights with the CE paradigm in organizations. © 2021",10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120766,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110265219&doi=10.1016%2fj.techfore.2021.120766&partnerID=40&md5=c669ed8168ece9af8514c0fb28d1aa34,,
"Exploring the relationship between supplier development, big data analytics capability, and firm performance",Journal,2021,Gu V.C.; Zhou B.; Cao Q.; Adams J.,"Extant research shows that big data analytics (BDA) capability is often employed as a part of organizational resources to enhance firm performance. Drawing upon the resource-based view, dynamic capabilities, and contingency theory, this study endeavors to examine the alignment between BDA capability and a specific type of procurement strategies (i.e., supplier development) and its impact on firm performance. The study extends the BDA capability research by investigating the direct impact of BDA capability on supplier development and firm performance, respectively, and by exploring both mediating and moderating effects on the relationship between supplier development and firm performance. The main results show that a firm’s BDA capability has not only a direct positive significant impact on supplier development, but also a direct positive significant impact on its business performance. More importantly, the results indicate strong moderating and mediating effects of BDA capability on supplier development, which in turn affects the improvement of firm performance.

Big data analytics capabilities and MSME innovation and performance: A double mediation model of digital platform and network capabilities,Journal,2022,Bhatti S.H.; Ahmed A.; Ferraris A.; Hirwani Wan Hussain W.M.; Wamba S.F.,"Drawing on dynamic capabilities and the resource-based view, we propose a conceptual model that encompasses big data analytics capabilities (BDAC), digital platform capabilities and network capabilities, supply chain innovation, and firm performance. We use the structural equation modeling to empirically validate this model on the time-lagged data of 221 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the manufacturing sectors. The empirical results of our data analysis showed that BDAC significantly improved platform and networking capabilities. BDAC also improved supply chain innovation and thus financial performance. Our data indicated that networking capabilities mediated the relationships of both (a) BDAC-supply chain innovation and (b) BDAC-financial performance. Meanwhile, digital platforms mediated only the BDAC-supply chain innovation relationship. The outcomes of sequential mediation confirmed the role of both digital platform and network capabilities and supply chain innovation in the BDAC-firm performance link. Our results provide theoretical implications to operations management and offer practical insights for managers working in manufacturing MSMEs. © 2022, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10479-022-05002-w,Annals of Operations Research,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139746012&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-022-05002-w&partnerID=40&md5=c6fdb269c72f07557f7e91071a6b3bba,,
"Supply chain collaboration and organisational performance: The effects of big data analytics capabilities, technological dynamism, and competitive intensity",Journal,2022,Barbosa M.W.; Ladeira M.B.; de Sousa P.R.; de Oliveira M.P.V.,"Although previous studies observed the effects of big data analytics (BDA) on firm performance, some gaps persist. One of the alternatives to improve performance in BDA contexts is to establish collaboration agreements. However, previous research has ignored the effects inter-organisational collaboration could have on supply chain relationships. Grounded on the relational view theory, this study aimed to assess the effects collaboration has on organisational performance, especially when mediated by BDA capabilities. A quantitative study was carried out with Brazilian retail companies and data were analysed using partial least squares – structural equation modelling. The retail sector is characterised as highly dynamic and competitive, so the moderating effect of the technological dynamism and competitive intensity on the relationship between collaboration and organisational performance has also been assessed. We have found out that collaboration has a direct effect on organisational performance, mediated by BDA capabilities and moderated by technological dynamism and competitive intensity.

Big data analytics and firm performance: Effects of dynamic capabilities,Journal,2017,Wamba S.F.; Gunasekaran A.; Akter S.; Ren S.J.-F.; Dubey R.; Childe S.J.,"Drawing on the resource-based view and the literature on big data analytics (BDA), information system (IS) success and the business value of information technology (IT), this study proposes a big data analytics capability (BDAC) model. The study extends the above research streams by examining the direct effects of BDAC on firm performance (FPER), as well as the mediating effects of process-oriented dynamic capabilities (PODC) on the relationship between BDAC and FPER. To test our proposed research model, we used an online survey to collect data from 297 Chinese IT managers and business analysts with big data and business analytic experience. The findings confirm the value of the entanglement conceptualization of the hierarchical BDAC model, which has both direct and indirect impacts on FPER. The results also confirm the strong mediating role of PODC in improving insights and enhancing FPER.

Big data analytics business value and firm performance: linking with environmental context,Journal,2020,Vitari C.; Raguseo E.,"Previous studies, grounded on the resource based view, have already explored the relationship between the business value that Big Data Analytics (BDA) can bring to firm performance. However, the role played by the environmental characteristics in which companies operate has not been investigated in the literature. We inform the theory, in that direction, via the integration of the contingency theory to the resource based view theory of the firm. This original and integrative model examines the moderating influence of environmental features on the relationship between BDA business value and firm performance. The combination of survey data and secondary financial data on a representative sample of medium and large companies makes possible the statistical validation of our research model. The results offer evidence that BDA business value leads to higher firm performance, namely financial performance, market performance and customer satisfaction. More original is the demonstration that this relationship is stronger in munificent environments, while the dynamism of the environment does not have any moderating effect on the performance of BDA solutions. It means that managers working for firms in markets with a growing demand are in the best position to profit from BDA. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/00207543.2019.1660822,International Journal of Production Research,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073780867&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2019.1660822&partnerID=40&md5=90539904a11b76aabce1231f8017a7aa,,
Improving Organizational Performance Through the Use of Big Data,Journal,2020,Ghasemaghaei M.,"The number of firms that plan to invest in big data usage has been reduced as many of them are still trying to understand the necessary conditions needed to improve their performance through the processing and use of big data. In this study, we leverage the resource-based view to investigate the role of tools sophistication, big data utilization, and employee analytical skills in improving organizational performance. The research model is validated empirically from 140 senior IT professionals using survey data. The findings show that when firms process big data, organizational performance is at its highest when firms use sophisticated tools, while this is not the case when firms do not process big data. Furthermore, findings show that, interestingly, at the lower levels of employee analytical skills, there is no significant impact of big data utilization on organizational performance, suggesting important implications for theory and for the guidance of business action. © 2018 International Association for Computer Information Systems.",10.1080/08874417.2018.1496805,Journal of Computer Information Systems,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052114611&doi=10.1080%2f08874417.2018.1496805&partnerID=40&md5=0a74252af2d00557aa082dce9a3e881c,,
Big data analytics capabilities and firm performance: An integrated MCDM approach,Journal,2020,Yasmin M.; Tatoglu E.; Kilic H.S.; Zaim S.; Delen D.,"This study explores the interdependence of big data analytics (BDA) capabilities and the impact of these capabilities on firm performance using an integrated multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology. Drawing on a rich data set obtained from selected case study firms in Pakistan, three MCDM tools, namely, intuitionistic fuzzy decision-making trial and evolution laboratory (IF-DEMATEL), analytic network process (ANP), and simple additive weighting (SAW), are employed to assess the relative importance of BDA capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities with the firm performance. The results show that BDA capabilities are interdependent, and infrastructure capabilities are the highest-ranked among all, followed by management and human resource capabilities, respectively. The SAW results indicate an association between BDA capabilities and firm performance.

Exploring the relationship between big data analytics capability and competitive performance: The mediating roles of dynamic and operational capabilities,Journal,2020,Mikalef P.; Krogstie J.; Pappas I.O.; Pavlou P.,"A central question for information systems (IS) researchers and practitioners is if, and how, big data can help attain a competitive advantage. To address this question, this study draws on the resource-based view, dynamic capabilities view, and on recent literature on big data analytics, and examines the indirect relationship between a firm's big data analytics capability (BDAC) and competitive performance. The study extends existing research by proposing that BDACs enable firms to generate insight that can help strengthen their dynamic capabilities, which, in turn, positively impact marketing and technological capabilities. To test our proposed research model, we used survey data from 202 chief information officers and IT managers working in Norwegian firms. By means of partial least squares structural equation modeling, results show that a strong BDAC can help firms build a competitive advantage. This effect is not direct but fully mediated by dynamic capabilities, which exerts a positive and significant effect on two types of operational capabilities: marketing and technological capabilities. The findings suggest that IS researchers should look beyond direct effects of big data investments and shift their attention on how a BDAC can be leveraged to enable and support organizational capabilities. © 2019 The Authors",10.1016/j.im.2019.05.004,Information and Management,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066428467&doi=10.1016%2fj.im.2019.05.004&partnerID=40&md5=3062edb934d3661d9098a563478bbcf9,,
How big data analytics improve supply chain performance: Considering the roles of supply chain and is strategy,Conference,2020,Chen W.; Wei S.; Yin J.; Chen X.,"This paper aims to examine the relationship between big data analytics (BDA) and supply chain (SC) performance. Drawing on the dynamic capabilities theory, we hypothesize that supply chain strategy (i.e., lean and agile supply chain strategy) will positively mediate the relationship between BDA and SC performance. Further, from the perspective of strategy alignment, we also hypothesize that the effect of supply chain strategy on SC performance will be moderated by IS strategy (i.e., IS innovator and IS conservative strategy). Our study uses 159 match-paired questionnaires collected from Chinese firms to empirically test the hypotheses. This paper explains how BDA can improve SC performance and reveals the interaction effect of IS strategy and supply chain strategy on SC performance, which contributes to theoretical and practical implications. © ICIS 2020.

The effect of big data analytics capability on firm performance: A pilot study in China,Conference,2020,Liu C.C.-H.; Mehandjiev N.,"Big data analytics (BDA) becomes a critical phenomenon today that brings revolution to firms in different ways, yet how firms create BDA capability that reflects on firm performance (FPER) in specific industry sectors is not yet clear, with the majority of existing studies taking cross-sector perspectives. This study addresses this gap by focusing on Consumer-Packaged Goods (CPG) & Retail industries in China, drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), and BDA literature. This paper presents the first pilot stage of the study, using a limited sample to derive an initial model of the relationship between BDAC and FPER, hypothesizing that it is partially mediated by the Digital Dynamic Capability (DDC). Apart from laying the foundation for the second stage of a more focused study by validating a measurement model, the analysis of the hypothesized structural model confirms some of the initial hypotheses. The results of our studies will benefit executives who face decision making before and after BDA investment.

Big data analytics capabilities and performance: Evidence from a moderated multi-mediation model,Journal,2019,Rialti R.; Zollo L.; Ferraris A.; Alon I.,"Big data analytics (BDA) have the power to revolutionize traditional ways of doing business. Nevertheless, the impact of BDA capabilities on a firm's performance is still not fully understood. These capabilities relate to the flexibility of the BDA infrastructure and the skills of the management and the firm's personnel. Most scholars explored the phenomenon from either a theoretical standpoint or neglected intermediate factors, such as organizational traits. This article builds on the dynamic capabilities view to propose and empirically test a model exploring whether organizational ambidexterity and agility mediate the relationship between BDA capabilities and organizational performance. Using data from surveys of 259 managers of large European organizations, we tested a proposed model using bootstrapped moderated mediation analysis. We found that organizational BDA capabilities affect a firm's ambidexterity and agility, which, in turn, affect its performance. These results establish ambidexterity and agility as positive mediators in the relationship between organizational BDA capabilities and a firm's performance. Furthermore, the organizational resistance to the implementation of information management systems and the fit between the organization and these systems also moderated this relationship. Practical implications for managers are also discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.techfore.2019.119781,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074131523&doi=10.1016%2fj.techfore.2019.119781&partnerID=40&md5=6c77c59c040b40987b4dc7088e29a169,,
Assessing the impact of big data on firm innovation performance: Big data is not always better data,Journal,2020,Ghasemaghaei M.; Calic G.,"In this study, we explore the impacts of big data's main characteristics (i.e., volume, variety, and velocity) on innovation performance (i.e., innovation efficacy and efficiency), which eventually impacts firm performance (i.e., customer perspective, financial returns, and operational excellence). To address this objective, we collected data from 239 managers and empirically examined the relationships in the proposed model. The results reveal that, while data variety and velocity positively enhance firm innovation performance, data volume has no significant impact. The finding that data volume does not play a critical role in enhancing firm innovation performance contributes novel insights to the literature by contradicting the prevalent belief that big data is better data. Moreover, the findings reveal that data velocity plays a more important role in improving firm innovation performance than other big data characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.09.062,Journal of Business Research,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075523713&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2019.09.062&partnerID=40&md5=892e3137f8c2623c14124f6dc1cef1d8,,
Big data analytics and firm performance: Findings from a mixed-method approach,Journal,2019,Mikalef P.; Boura M.; Lekakos G.; Krogstie J.,"Big data analytics has been widely regarded as a breakthrough technological development in academic and business communities. Despite the growing number of firms that are launching big data initiatives, there is still limited understanding on how firms translate the potential of such technologies into business value. The literature argues that to leverage big data analytics and realize performance gains, firms must develop strong big data analytics capabilities. Nevertheless, most studies operate under the assumption that there is limited heterogeneity in the way firms build their big data analytics capabilities and that related resources are of similar importance regardless of context. This paper draws on complexity theory and investigates the configurations of resources and contextual factors that lead to performance gains from big data analytics investments. Our empirical investigation followed a mixed methods approach using survey data from 175 chief information officers and IT managers working in Greek firms, and three case studies to show that depending on the context, big data analytics resources differ in significance when considering performance gains. Applying a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method on the quantitative data, we show that there are four different patterns of elements surrounding big data analytics that lead to high performance. Outcomes of the three case studies highlight the inter-relationships between these elements and outline challenges that organizations face when orchestrating big data analytics resources. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.01.044,Journal of Business Research,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061615845&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2019.01.044&partnerID=40&md5=7df128a3ec687bc621a924f4509a45ec,,

Boosting innovation performance through big data analytics:An empirical investigationon the role of firm agility,Journal,2023,ZareRavasan A.,"While past studies proposed the role of big data analytics (BDA) as one of the primary pathways to business value creation, current knowledge on the link between BDA and innovation performance remains limited. In this regard, this study intends to fill this research gap by developing a theoretical framework for understanding how and under which mechanisms BDA influences innovation performance. Firm agility (conceptualised as sensing agility, decision-making agility and acting agility) is used in this research as the mediator between BDA and innovation performance. Besides, this research conceptualises two moderating variables: data-driven culture and BDA team sophistication. This study employs partial least squares (PLS) to test and validate the proposed hypotheses using survey data of 185 firms. The results show that firm agility significantly mediates the link between BDA use and innovation performance. Besides, the results suggest that data-driven culture moderates the relation between sensing agility and decision-making agility. This research also supports the moderating role of BDA team sophistication on the link between BDA use and sensing agility. © The Author(s) 2021.",10.1177/01655515211047425,Journal of Information Science,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116973032&doi=10.1177%2f01655515211047425&partnerID=40&md5=32da97c0610a7fd20de0f2a50fef5ec1,,
Understanding the Relationship between Big Data Analytics Capabilities and Sustainable Performance: The Role of Strategic Agility and Firm Creativity,Journal,2023,Alyahya M.; Aliedan M.; Agag G.; Abdelmoety Z.H.,"The most successful organisations create businesses that can respond to sudden and unexpected changes in the market. The purpose of this research is to examine how big data analytics capabilities might, through strategic agility, impact on sustainable performance. We grounded our theoretical framework in two perspectives: the resource-based view and the dynamic capabilities view. In order to gather data from Saudi Arabian managers, we used the positivist methodology of a survey. Data were collected from 410 managers. The data were analysed using the SEM method. The findings indicated that big data analytics capabilities have a significant effect on economic, environmental, and social performance. They also revealed that strategic agility partially mediates the relationship between the capabilities of big data analytics and sustainable performance. Furthermore, the impact of big data analytics capabilities on strategic agility is stronger in a creative environment, while the strategic agility–sustainable performance relationship is more pronounced in more creative environments.

The moderating connections and direct relationships were examined using Hays' process macro and structural equation modeling. Findings: BDAC was positively related to EO and SSCP. When supply chain partners experienced low levels of trust, an increase in BDAC did not enhance SSCP. As trust increased, the relationship between BDAC and SSCP became more positive, underpinning the moderating effects of trust. Moreover, trust did not moderate the relationship between BDAC and EO. The moderating effect of trust on the relationship between EO and SSCP showed a positive relationship between EO and SSCP when trust was low; however, the relationship became negative when trust was high. Practical implications: Developing technology alone may not be sufficient, as supply chain managers need to establish a strong business relationship based on mutual trust. However, they also need to be aware of the dangers of high levels of trust because these may negatively affect performance. Therefore, supply chain managers need to achieve an optimal level of trust that is neither excessive nor insufficient. Originality/value: Advances in technology and entrepreneurial drive for supply chain sustainability make it pertinent to examine trust levels among supply chain partners and the varying impact on BDAC, EO and SSCP. The current study shows the negative aspects of too much trust among supply chain partners. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/BIJ-04-2023-0206,Benchmarking,Scopus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174298899&doi=10.1108%2fBIJ-04-2023-0206&partnerID=40&md5=469a623b372f355f584ba213827ac834,,
